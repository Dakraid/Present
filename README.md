# Present by Kristian "Dakraid" Schlikow

Present is an all-in-one portfolio and project website for myself. It is built with Nuxt 3, Shadcn-Vue, and various other modules like Nuxt Content.

It is still under heavy development, so expect things to change.

### Note

- Currently, the website is not hosted anywhere, so you can't visit it.
- Content will be pulled during CI/CD and is not part of the repository.
